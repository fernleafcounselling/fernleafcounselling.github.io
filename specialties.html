        <p class="mb-5">
          I especially enjoy working with people who feel a bit out of step with the world around them — the ones who’ve spent years trying to mask, contort, or “hold it together,” often at the expense of their own wellbeing. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
          If you’ve ever been told you’re <i>too much, not enough, doing it wrong,</i> or that you just need to try harder, you’re not alone. Many of the people I work with have learned to see themselves as the problem, 
          when in reality they’ve been navigating systems and expectations that don’t fit.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">
          In our work together, I’m not interested in fixing you or forcing you into a version of yourself that looks better on paper. 
          Instead, we’ll focus on understanding what’s actually going on, what’s been helping you survive, and what might help you live with a bit more ease, honesty, and self-trust.

            <p>
            I’ve spent over a decade supporting autistic and otherwise neurodivergent people and their families. I don’t see neurodivergence as something to fix — I see it as something to understand. 
            My work makes space for your strengths, sensitivities, and the real challenges that come from living in a world that often isn’t built with you in mind. 
            No masking, no judgment — just collaborative support focused on helping you live in a way that feels more true to who you are.

            <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-center">Anxiety</h3>
            <p>
              Whether it shows up as spiralling thoughts, avoidance, perfectionism, or a constant sense of “not enough,” I help people build flexibility and compassion while moving toward what matters. 
              ACT is especially helpful here — not to get rid of anxiety, but to change your relationship with it.

            <p>
              As a queer therapist, I know how powerful it is to sit with someone who gets the nuances without you having to over-explain. I offer an affirming space to explore identity, relationships, belonging, 
              and the many joys and challenges of living authentically.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-center">Parents</h3>
            <p>
             Parenting a neurodivergent child can be deeply meaningful, and also deeply exhausting. Many parents I work with are doing their best in systems that weren’t built for their kids, or for them. 
            You may be navigating advocacy, burnout, guilt, or constant second-guessing, all while trying to stay regulated yourself. I bring a practical, compassionate lens to this work. 
              We can make sense of what’s happening, clarify what actually helps your child and your family, and find ways to support you alongside your parenting role. 
              This isn’t about perfect strategies or fixing your child—it’s about building understanding, flexibility, and sustainability in a system that often demands too much.

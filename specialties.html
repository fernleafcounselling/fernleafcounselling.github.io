          I especially enjoy working with people who feel a bit out of step with the world around them — the ones who've spent years trying to mask, contort, or “hold it together,” often at the expense of their own wellbeing.

            <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-center">Neurodivergent teens and adults</h3>
            <p>
              I've spent over a decade supporting autistic and otherwise neurodivergent folks and their families. I take a neuro-affirming, collaborative approach that makes space for your strengths, sensitivities, and the real barriers you face. No masking pressure. No pathologizing. Just support that respects your lived experience and helps you build a life that works for <i>you</i>.

            <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-center">Anxiety</h3>
            <p>
              Whether it shows up as spiralling thoughts, avoidance, perfectionism, or a constant sense of “not enough,” I help people build flexibility and compassion while moving toward what matters. ACT is especially helpful here — not to get rid of anxiety, but to change your relationship with it.

            <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-center">LGBTQ2S+</h3>
            <p>
              As a queer therapist, I know how powerful it is to sit with someone who gets the nuances without you having to over-explain. I offer an affirming space to explore identity, relationships, belonging, and the many joys and challenges of living authentically.

            <p>
              If you've ever felt misunderstood, over-labeled, or pressured to squeeze into strategies that don't fit, you're in the right place. My work is relational, flexible, and collaborative — grounded in ACT, behaviour science, and a deep respect for the messy nature of being human.

      <div class="bg-white p-10">
        <h2 class="text-5xl mb-5 text-center">About Me</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">
          Hi, I'm Allison. I'm a practicum counsellor with a background in behavior support, training in Acceptance and Commitment
          Therapy (ACT), and a deep respect for the messy, imperfect nature of being human.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
          Before starting my counselling journey, I spent over a decade supporting neurodivergent kids, teens, and their families. That work taught me a lot about systems - how they shape us and how we can challenge them. It also taught me to stay flexible, meet people where they are, and focus on what actually works for the individual.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
          I bring a neuro and queer-affirming approach to therapy. I especially enjoy working with neurodivergent (Autistic, ADHD) and anxious clients who are tired of trying to "fix" themselves and are curious about what it might look like to live more fully and authentically. Our work might include building practical skills, unpacking internalized expectations, or identifying what matters to you and how to move toward it so that you can build a life that feels like yours.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
          Humor, curiosity, and openness are important to me, and I will bring these qualities into our work together. I believe therapy should be relational, collaborative, and grounded in respect. I aim to be authentic, warm, and gently challenging when needed. I don't think there's one right path through life, but I'll walk with you while we figure out which direction feels worth exploring.
        </p>
